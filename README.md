# ML_3Dprinting_properties_prediction
Project for Master's degree

The goal of this thesis was to implement machine learning models to predict the 
displacements and stresses of simple CAD models with different types of lattices. Creo 
Parametric software was selected as the CAD modelling software platform. Calculations and 
simulations were also performed using it. The machine learning model was prepared in the 
Google Colaboratory environment and written in Python.
